### 1\. Welcome!

Python is an easy to learn programming language. You can use it to create web apps, games, even a search engine!

(파이썬은 배우기 쉬운 프로그래밍 언어입니다. 당신은 이것으로 웹  앱, 게임, 심지어 검색 엔진까지 만들수 있습니다.)

### 2. Variables

Creating web apps, games, and search engines all involve storing and working with different types of data. They do so using **variables**. A **variable** stores a piece of data, and gives it a specific name.

\# Write your code below!
my_variable = 10

### 3\. Booleans

A **boolean** is like a light switch. It can only have two values. Just like a light switch can only be on or off, a boolean can only be `True` or `False`.

\# Set the variables to the values listed in the instructions!

my_int = 7
my_float = 1.23
my_bool = True

### 4\. You've Been Reassigned

\# my_int is set to 7 below. What do you think
\# will happen if we reset it to 3 and print the result?

my_int = 7

\# Change the value of my_int to 3 on line 8!

my_int = 3

\# Here's some code that will print my_int to the console:
\# The print keyword will be covered in detail soon!

print my_int
